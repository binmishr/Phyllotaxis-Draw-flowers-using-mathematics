# Phyllotaxis: Draw flowers using mathematics

Project Description 
==================== 
R is a tool for doing serious statistics and data analysis. But not everything in life can be serious, life is also beautiful, and R can make beautiful things too.R can make art. The arrangement of leaves on a plant stem is ruled by spirals. This fact is called phyllotaxis and it is a nice example of how mathematics can describe patterns in nature. In this project, we will invent flowers using this fact.

This R project assumes you have familiarity with the R ,ggplot2 package. Its recommended you take knowledge of R package Tidyverse or Data Visualization with ggplot2 . If you want to see more examples of how you can use R to make art, you should check out the Fronkonstin blog created by Antonio Sánchez Chinchón.
